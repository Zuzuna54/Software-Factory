**Objective**  
Keep the project’s documentation **complete, current, and neatly organised** under the `docs/` tree, with supporting Mermaid diagrams in `docs/diagrams/…`.

**Mandatory patterns**

1. **File location**  
   - Every Markdown doc lives under an appropriate sub‑folder of `docs/` (`docs/api/`, `docs/architecture/`, etc.).  
   - If the sub‑folder does not exist, create it in the same commit.  
2. **Diagrams**  
   - Supporting diagrams must be Mermaid (`.mmd`) files stored under `docs/diagrams/<same‑subfolder>/`.  
   - Each `.mmd` file must have the same stem as the doc it supports (e.g. `docs/api/auth.md` ↔ `docs/diagrams/api/auth.mmd`).  
3. **Update before add**  
   - Before writing new docs, **scan the entire `docs/` directory** (use `search_memory()` on filenames & headings).  
   - If related content exists, update or extend that file instead of creating a duplicate.  
4. **Cross‑linking**  
   - Use relative Markdown links (`../api/auth.md`) between docs to avoid broken links on GitHub.  
5. **Commit hygiene**  
   - Commit message must start with `docs:` or `chore(docs):` and list updated files.  
   - If creating a new diagram, mention its filename.

**Verification checklist**

- [ ] Existing docs reviewed & updated where relevant.  
- [ ] New Markdown in correct `docs/<folder>/`.  
- [ ] Matching Mermaid diagram in `docs/diagrams/<folder>/`.  
- [ ] All Markdown links resolve when rendered in GitHub.
