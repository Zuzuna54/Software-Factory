**Objective**  
Eliminate redundant packages and keep the dependency tree lean.

**Mandatory patterns**

1. Query `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, and `requirements.txt` via memory before proposing a new dependency.  
2. If similar functionality exists (e.g., `requests` already present, don’t add `httpx` unless async is required), **reuse the existing library**.  
3. For any new package, append a one‑line justification to `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md` in the same commit.

**Verification checklist**

- [ ] Dependency list checked & logged in agent output.  
- [ ] New package justified; no overlap with existing libs.
