**Objective**  
Deliver **exactly what the user requested, and nothing more**.  
Do not add, refactor or “improve” unrelated parts of the codebase unless the user explicitly instructs you to.

**Mandatory patterns**

1. Parse the latest user message into a bullet list of concrete tasks.  
2. Execute only those tasks—**no silent additions** such as bonus endpoints, refactors or stylistic tweaks.  
3. If the request is ambiguous, ask for clarification instead of guessing.  

**Verification checklist**

- [ ] Every code change maps to a bullet in the parsed request.  
- [ ] No unrelated files touched.
