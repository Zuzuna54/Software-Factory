alwaysApply: true

**Objective**  
Always choose the **simplest possible solution** that meets the explicit requirements.  
Introduce additional layers, patterns or dependencies **only** when a simpler option demonstrably fails.

**Mandatory patterns**

1. Prefer native language / framework constructs over custom wrappers.  
2. Ask “**Why can’t a simpler alternative work?**” before adding abstraction.  
3. Keep new functions ≤ 40 LOC; split if larger.  
4. No speculative features for “future needs” unless the user explicitly requests them.

**Verification checklist**

- [ ] Implementation matches simplest known pattern.  
- [ ] No unused parameters, dead code or vestigial TODOs.  
- [ ] Complexity justified in commit message if added.
