**Objective**  
Before writing new code, **search the entire repository** for similar functions, classes or utilities to avoid duplication.

**Mandatory patterns**

1. Run a semantic search (`search_memory()`) with key terms from the intended feature.  
2. If existing code offers 80 %+ of required behavior, **reuse or extend it** instead of rewriting.  
3. Add new symbols only when (a) functionality is novel, or (b) reuse would create tight coupling.

**Verification checklist**

- [ ] Memory search results attached to the “thinking” step.  
- [ ] Commit message cites why reuse wasn’t possible if new code added.
