# Autonomous AI Development Team

This project implements a fully autonomous AI-powered software development team capable of planning, coding, testing, and deploying applications with minimal human intervention.

## Repository Structure

- `/agents` - Core agent implementation and orchestration
- `/infra` - Infrastructure configuration
- `/dashboard` - Monitoring and control dashboard
- `/docs` - Documentation and specifications
- `/app` - Application code generated by AI agents

## System Overview

The system consists of multiple LLM-powered agents organized into a team structure that mimics a real software engineering organization:

- Product Manager Agent
- Scrum Master Agent
- Technical Lead Agents (Frontend, Backend)
- Developer Agents (Frontend, Backend)
- QA/Test Agent
- DevOps/Infrastructure Agent
- Database Administrator Agent

All agents communicate via a structured protocol and coordinate through a central orchestration mechanism, with a comprehensive PostgreSQL-based logging system that captures every action, message, decision, and thought process.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.12, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.0 (+ async engine), Celery 5
- **Frontend**: TypeScript 5.5, Next.js 14, React 19-RC, Tailwind, shadcn/ui
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 with pgvector for embeddings
- **Embeddings**: Gemini embeddings via Vertex AI
- **Infrastructure**: Google Cloud Platform (Cloud SQL, Cloud Run)

## Getting Started
