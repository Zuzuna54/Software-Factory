The most significant achievement was creating a highly integrated system where all components work together seamlessly. The comprehensive logging system provides visibility into all agent operations, the communication protocol enables structured interactions, and the vector memory system enables semantic knowledge management.

These foundational components provide a solid base for developing specialized agents in subsequent iterations. The framework is now ready for the implementation of domain-specific agents that can collaborate on software development tasks.
