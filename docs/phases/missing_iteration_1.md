# Analysis of Iteration 2 & 3 Implementation Status

This document analyzes the implemented code against the goals set forth in `docs/phases/iteration_2.md` and `docs/phases/iteration_3.md`.

## Iteration 2: Scrum Master, Product Manager & Task Orchestration

**Goal:** Implement core orchestration components (PM, Scrum Master agents), task queue (Celery/Redis), task tracking (DB), artifact storage, and project kickoff.

### Implemented Features:

1.  **`ProductManagerAgent` (`agents/specialized/product_manager.py`):**
    - Successfully implements `analyze_requirements` using the LLM provider (`think` method from `BaseAgent`).
    - Parses LLM response (expected JSON) to extract structured requirements (vision, features, stories, NFRs).
    - Implements `_store_requirements` to persist the vision in `project_vision` and features/stories/NFRs in the `artifacts` table, matching the planned schema.
    - Handles basic error logging during analysis and parsing.
2.  **`ScrumMasterAgent` (`agents/specialized/scrum_master.py`):**
    - Successfully implements `plan_sprint` using the LLM (`think`) to generate a sprint plan from backlog items.
    - Implements `_create_sprint` to insert sprint details into the `sprints` table.
    - Implements `_create_sprint_tasks` to parse the plan and insert tasks into the `tasks` table, linking them to features/stories via `related_artifacts`.
    - Implements `assign_task` and `update_task_status` to modify task records in the DB.
    - References `ceremonies` and `meetings` modules (found in `agents/orchestration/`), though their specific functionality wasn't analyzed.
3.  **Celery Task Queue (`agents/tasks/`):**
    - `celery_app.py` correctly defines and configures the Celery application using Redis as broker/backend and includes `agents.tasks.agent_tasks`.
    - `agent_tasks.py` defines `shared_task` wrappers for key PM and SM methods (`analyze_requirements_task`, `plan_sprint_task`, `assign_task_to_agent_task`, `update_task_status_task`).
    - Tasks correctly handle asynchronous component initialization (`_initialize_components`) and cleanup (`_cleanup_components`) within the synchronous Celery context using `run_async`.
4.  **Database & Infrastructure:**
    - `schema.sql` defines the necessary tables (`tasks`, `artifacts`, `sprints`, `project_vision`).
    - `docker-compose.yml` sets up Redis, Postgres, and Celery worker/beat services.

### Missing Features & Next Steps:

1.  **Task Triggering Mechanism:**
    - **Missing:** How are the Celery tasks (`analyze_requirements_task`, `plan_sprint_task`, etc.) initially triggered? The CLI doesn't seem to call them.
    - **Task:** Implement a way to invoke these tasks. Options:
      - Add commands to `agents/cli/agent_cli.py` to dispatch specific Celery tasks (e.g., `python agent_cli.py task dispatch analyze_requirements --description "..."`).
      - Create API endpoints in the FastAPI application (`app/api/endpoints/`) that trigger these tasks.
      - Have agents trigger tasks via messages (requires implementing message processing logic - see below).
2.  **Agent Task Consumption/Notification:**
    - **Missing:** How does an agent (e.g., a Developer) get notified when a task is assigned to it via `assign_task_to_agent_task`? How does it retrieve the task details and start working?
    - **Task:** Implement agent task processing logic:
      - Modify `ScrumMasterAgent.assign_task` (and its Celery wrapper) to potentially send a direct `AgentMessage` (type `TASK_ASSIGNMENT`) to the assigned agent _after_ updating the DB.
      - Implement a core processing loop or message handler in `BaseAgent` (or specialized agents) that periodically checks for new messages (using `receive_messages`) or listens for specific message types (like `TASK_ASSIGNMENT`).
      - When a `TASK_ASSIGNMENT` message is received, the agent should query the `tasks` table using the `related_task_id` from the message to get full details and then invoke its relevant implementation method (e.g., `BackendDeveloperAgent.implement_api_endpoint`).
3.  **Project Kickoff:**
    - **Missing:** An explicit function or entry point to start a new project cycle (e.g., taking an initial description and triggering the PM's `analyze_requirements_task`).
    - **Task:** Define a "kickoff" mechanism. This could be:
      - A dedicated Celery task `kickoff_project_task(project_description)`.
      - An API endpoint `/projects/kickoff`.
      - A specific CLI command.
        This mechanism should invoke `analyze_requirements_task`.
4.  **Celery Beat Usage:**
    - **Missing:** While the `celery_beat` service is defined, no scheduled tasks are apparent in the viewed code.
    - **Task:** Define scheduled tasks if needed (e.g., daily standup triggers, sprint status checks). This involves configuring the schedule in `celery_app.py` or using Django admin via `django-celery-beat` if a Django integration is planned (unlikely given FastAPI focus).

## Iteration 3: "Hello World" Development & QA Loop

**Goal:** Implement `BackendDeveloperAgent`, `QAAgent`, Git integration, CI triggers, bug reporting loop, and basic context reading.

### Implemented Features:

1.  **`BackendDeveloperAgent` (`agents/specialized/backend_developer.py`):**
    - Implements `implement_api_endpoint` using LLM to generate code + tests based on specs and basic context.
    - Implements `_write_implementation_files` to save generated code to disk.
    - Integrates with `GitClient` to commit generated files via `commit_changes`.
    - Implements `fix_code_issue` structure (logic requires LLM call).
    - Implements `_analyze_codebase` but it's currently a placeholder fetching limited file content from the `artifacts` table, not performing deep analysis or vector search.
2.  **`QAAgent` (`agents/specialized/qa_agent.py`):**
    - Implements `run_tests` using `subprocess` to execute `pytest`.
    - Implements `_parse_pytest_output` to extract summary and failing tests using regex.
    - Implements `_analyze_test_failures` using LLM to suggest root causes based on test/implementation file content and error messages.
    - Implements `report_bug` structure (likely logs bug details, possibly sends a message).
3.  **Git Integration (`agents/git/git_client.py`):**
    - Provides asynchronous methods for `init`, `add`, `commit`, `branch`, `checkout`, `log`, etc., by running `git` commands in a subprocess.
4.  **Testing Framework:**
    - `pytest` and related libraries are included in `requirements.txt`.
    - `pytest.ini` provides basic configuration.

### Missing Features & Next Steps:

1.  **Autonomous Dev Loop Triggering:**
    - **Missing:** How is the `BackendDeveloperAgent` triggered to implement a specific task assigned by the Scrum Master? How is the `QAAgent` triggered after a commit?
    - **Task:** Connect the loop using the Task Consumption mechanism described in Iteration 2's missing features.
      - A Developer agent, upon receiving a `TASK_ASSIGNMENT`, should call its `implement_api_endpoint` (or similar) method.
      - The `implement_api_endpoint` method, after successfully committing code with `GitClient`, needs to trigger the QA process. This could involve:
        - Sending an `AgentMessage` (type `CODE_COMMITTED`) to the `QAAgent`.
        - Alternatively, relying on an external CI system (GitHub Actions) to trigger QA.
2.  **CI/Webhook Integration:**
    - **Missing:** The logic to trigger the `QAAgent.run_tests` based on a Git commit/push event (e.g., via GitHub Actions webhook).
    - **Task:** Implement CI integration:
      - Define a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that checks out the code and triggers tests on push events.
      - This workflow could either:
        - Call `pytest` directly within the action runner.
        - Trigger a dedicated QA service/API endpoint (part of the FastAPI app?) that invokes `QAAgent.run_tests` (perhaps via a Celery task `run_tests_task`).
      - The results of the CI run need to be communicated back to the system (e.g., update task status, trigger bug report).
3.  **Bug Reporting -> Fixing Loop:**
    - **Missing:** How does a bug report generated by `QAAgent.report_bug` (after test failure analysis) get assigned back to the `BackendDeveloperAgent` and trigger `fix_code_issue`?
    - **Task:** Implement the feedback loop:
      - `QAAgent.report_bug` should ideally create a new "BUG" task in the `tasks` table and potentially assign it back to the original developer (if known) or flag it for the Scrum Master.
      - Alternatively, it could send an `AgentMessage` (type `BUG_REPORT`) directly to the developer or Scrum Master.
      - The developer agent needs logic (part of its task consumption loop) to recognize BUG tasks or messages and invoke `fix_code_issue` with the relevant details (file path, description, test failure).
4.  **Enhanced Codebase Analysis:**
    - **Missing:** The `BackendDeveloperAgent._analyze_codebase` is too basic. It doesn't leverage the `EnhancedVectorMemory` to find relevant existing code patterns or files based on the current task.
    - **Task:** Refactor `_analyze_codebase`:
      - Use `self.memory_search.search_entities` (or similar method from `vector_memory`/`memory_search`) to find relevant code snippets (`entity_type='Code'`) based on the task description/requirements embedding.
      - Retrieve content of relevant files (maybe using `GitClient` or assuming files are accessible).
      - Summarize findings to provide context to the LLM in `implement_api_endpoint` or `fix_code_issue`.
5.  **Developer Task Status Updates:**
    - **Missing:** The Developer agent doesn't seem to update the task status (e.g., to "IN_PROGRESS", "IN_REVIEW", "DONE") after starting work or committing code.
    - **Task:** Add calls to `self.comm_protocol.send_task_update` (or similar, potentially triggering `update_task_status_task`) within the Developer agent's workflow (e.g., start of `implement_api_endpoint`, after `git_client.commit_changes`).

By addressing these missing pieces, particularly the task triggering/consumption loop and the CI/bug feedback mechanism, the project can move closer to the autonomous development capabilities outlined in the blueprint.
