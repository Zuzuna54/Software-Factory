# Autonomous AI Development Team: Implementation Phases

This directory contains the implementation plan for the Autonomous AI Development Team, organized into logical iterations. Each iteration builds upon previous work to create a complete, autonomous software development system.

## Overview

The implementation is divided into 11 iterations, each focusing on specific aspects of the system:

1. **Iteration 0: Infrastructure Bootstrap** - Repository structure, database schema, and development environment
2. **Iteration 1: Core Agent Framework** - Base agent implementation, LLM integration, and communication protocol
3. **Iteration 2: Product Manager, Scrum Master & Agile Ceremonies** - Orchestration components and agile workflow
4. **Iteration 3: Developer Agents, QA & Testing Framework** - Development and testing capabilities
5. **Iteration 4: Knowledge Base & Artifact Traceability** - Shared knowledge and artifact relationships
6. **Iteration 5: Technical Leads & Review Processes** - Architecture decisions and code reviews
7. **Iteration 6: DevOps Agent & Deployment Pipeline** - Infrastructure and deployment automation
8. **Iteration 7: Existing Codebase Integration** - Analysis and extension of existing code
9. **Iteration 8: Dashboard & Visibility System** - Monitoring and visualization
10. **Iteration 9: Security & Performance Optimization** - Security hardening and performance improvements
11. **Iteration 10: Human Collaboration & System Evolution** - Human-agent interaction and continuous learning
12. **Iteration 11: Comprehensive Artifact Storage & Management** - Complete artifact lifecycle management

## Iteration Structure

Each iteration file follows a consistent structure:

- **Objective**: The overall goal of the iteration
- **Tasks**: Detailed tasks to be completed, each with:
  - Description of what needs to be done
  - Specific actions to take
  - Deliverables to produce
- **Dependencies**: Previous iterations that must be completed first
- **Verification Criteria**: How to verify the iteration was successful

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows these principles:

1. **Incremental Development**: Each iteration builds upon previous work
2. **Clear Dependencies**: Dependencies between iterations are explicitly defined
3. **Actionable Tasks**: Tasks are specific and include file-level references
4. **Verification**: Each iteration includes clear criteria for success
5. **Traceability**: Tasks are linked to the blueprint requirements

## Traceability to Blueprint

These iterations implement all components described in the blueprint:

- **Agent Roles**: All agent roles from the blueprint are implemented across iterations
- **Database Schema**: Complete schema implementation in Iteration 0 and extended in Iteration 11
- **Communication Protocol**: Structured messaging in Iteration 1
- **Agile Ceremonies**: Complete ceremony implementation in Iteration 2
- **Artifact Storage**: Comprehensive storage across iterations, culminating in Iteration 11
- **Knowledge Base**: Implemented in Iteration 4
- **Dashboard**: Implemented in Iteration 8
- **Existing Codebase Integration**: Implemented in Iteration 7
- **Security & Performance**: Implemented in Iteration 9
- **Human Collaboration**: Implemented in Iteration 10

## Getting Started

To begin implementation, start with Iteration 0 and proceed sequentially through the iterations, ensuring that verification criteria are met before proceeding to the next iteration.
