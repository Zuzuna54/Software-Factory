- Integration with development processes

### Phase 5: Integration and Training (Week 5)

1. **Rules Metadata Enhancement**

   - Add version information to all rules
   - Implement cross-references between related rules
   - Create changelog entries

2. **Performance Optimization**

   - Analyze rule trigger patterns
   - Optimize always-apply vs. auto-attached balance
   - Measure and document context size impact

3. **Team Training**
   - Create usage guidelines for developers
   - Develop onboarding materials
   - Document best practices for rule creation and maintenance

**Deliverables:**

- Fully integrated ruleset
- Performance metrics
- Training and onboarding materials

## Migration Strategy

### Current to New Rule Mapping

| Current Rule            | New Rule(s)                                    | Changes                                          |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| project-overview.mdc    | core/project-overview.mdc                      | Enhanced structure, added versioning             |
| docs-guidelines.mdc     | workflow/documentation-standards.mdc           | Expanded with examples, improved verification    |
| simplicity‑first.mdc    | core/simplicity-first.mdc                      | Added examples, improved rationale               |
| dependency‑audit.mdc    | core/dependency-audit.mdc                      | Added concrete examples, enhanced verification   |
| no‑code‑duplication.mdc | core/no-code-duplication.mdc                   | Added search patterns, improved verification     |
| exact‑scope.mdc         | core/exact-scope.mdc                           | Added examples, clarified application            |
| naming-conventions.mdc  | core/naming-conventions.mdc                    | Expanded with language-specific examples         |
| infra-guidelines.mdc    | domain/infrastructure/deployment-standards.mdc | Enhanced with detailed patterns                  |
| testing-standards.mdc   | domain/testing/testing-standards.mdc           | Added concrete examples and patterns             |
| frontend-standards.mdc  | Multiple domain/frontend/\*.mdc files          | Split into component, state, accessibility rules |
| backend-standards.mdc   | Multiple domain/backend/\*.mdc files           | Split into API, database, error handling rules   |

### Transition Approach

1. **Parallel Operation**

   - Keep both old and new rules during transition
   - Phase out old rules as new ones are validated

2. **Incremental Validation**

   - Test each new rule individually
   - Monitor AI behavior with new rules
   - Gather metrics on rule effectiveness

3. **Team Communication**
   - Document changes and improvements
   - Provide clear migration guides
   - Share best practices for working with the new system

## Performance Considerations

1. **Context Size Management**

   - Monitor token usage with new rule structure
   - Optimize rule trigger patterns
   - Balance between always-apply and context-specific rules

2. **Response Time Impact**

   - Measure AI response time changes
   - Identify and optimize slow-performing rules
   - Document performance characteristics

3. **Optimization Techniques**
   - Implement progressive disclosure in rules
   - Use external file references for examples
   - Apply appropriate scoping for all rules

## Governance and Maintenance

1. **Review Cycle**

   - Establish quarterly rule review process
   - Create metrics for rule effectiveness
   - Document update procedures

2. **Version Control**

   - Implement semantic versioning for all rules
   - Maintain changelog for rule updates
   - Document breaking changes

3. **Contribution Guidelines**
   - Create process for suggesting new rules
   - Establish approval workflow for rule changes
   - Document testing requirements for rule updates

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All rules are migrated to the new structure
2. Performance metrics show improvement or no degradation
3. Team members report improved AI interactions
4. Documentation is complete and up-to-date
5. Governance processes are established and followed
