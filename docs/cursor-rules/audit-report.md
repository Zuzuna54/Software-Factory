# Cursor Rules Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This audit examined the current Cursor rules implementation in the Software Factory project to identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement. The analysis found that while the existing ruleset provides good coverage of core project standards, several opportunities exist to enhance rule organization, optimize enforcement patterns, and align with enterprise-grade best practices.

## Current Implementation

The Software Factory project currently implements **11 Cursor rules** in the `.cursor/rules` directory:

| Rule File               | Type            | Purpose                                            |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| project-overview.mdc    | Always Apply    | High-level doctrine for the autonomous AI dev team |
| docs-guidelines.mdc     | Always Apply    | Documentation and diagram standards                |
| simplicity‑first.mdc    | Always Apply    | Enforce KISS & YAGNI principles                    |
| dependency‑audit.mdc    | Always Apply    | Control and audit package dependencies             |
| no‑code‑duplication.mdc | Always Apply    | Prevent duplicate logic                            |
| exact‑scope.mdc         | Always Apply    | Enforce precise adherence to user requirements     |
| naming-conventions.mdc  | Agent Requested | Defines naming and documentation standards         |
| infra-guidelines.mdc    | Always Apply    | Deployment and infrastructure standards            |
| testing-standards.mdc   | Auto-Attached   | Test and QA expectations                           |
| frontend-standards.mdc  | Unknown         | Frontend development standards                     |
| backend-standards.mdc   | Unknown         | Backend development standards                      |

## Strengths

1. **Comprehensive Coverage** - Rules address key areas including code style, infrastructure, testing, and documentation
2. **Clear Structure** - Most rules follow a consistent format with objectives, patterns, and verification checklists
3. **Well-Defined Project Foundation** - The project-overview rule provides clear technology choices and architecture
4. **Quality Focus** - Multiple rules enforce key quality attributes like simplicity, testability, and non-duplication

## Gaps and Weaknesses

1. **Inconsistent Rule Types** - Some rules lack clear type definitions or have suboptimal types
2. **Missing Glob Patterns** - Several auto-attached rules don't specify glob patterns to trigger them
3. **Limited Rule Organization** - No nested organization for domain-specific rules
4. **Incomplete Verification** - Some verification checklists lack specific, actionable items
5. **Absence of Examples** - Few rules include concrete examples to illustrate implementation
6. **No Version Control** - Rules lack versioning metadata for tracking changes
7. **Limited Cross-References** - Rules operate in isolation rather than forming a cohesive system

## Recommendations

1. **Standardize Rule Format** - Ensure all rules follow a consistent MDC format with proper metadata
2. **Implement Nested Organization** - Create subdirectories for domain-specific rules
3. **Add Concrete Examples** - Include reference implementations for key patterns
4. **Enhance Verification Methods** - Add more specific verification tests for each rule
5. **Include Referenced Files** - Add @filename references where applicable
6. **Add Version Control** - Implement versioning metadata for rules
7. **Create Cross-References** - Reference related rules to create a more cohesive system

## Detailed Findings

### Rule Structure Analysis

Most rules follow this structure:

- Metadata header with description and application scope
- Objective statement
- Mandatory patterns (numbered list)
- Verification checklist

However, implementation varies significantly:

- Some rules like `project-overview.mdc` use a more free-form structure
- Verification checklists range from specific to vague
- Some rules include categorized sections, others don't

### Rule Type Distribution

- **Always Apply**: 7 rules
- **Auto-Attached**: 1 rule
- **Agent-Requested**: 1 rule
- **Unknown/Undefined**: 2 rules

This distribution shows a heavy reliance on always-apply rules, which may impact performance by including unnecessary context in some situations.

### Content Quality Assessment

Content quality varies across the ruleset:

- Some rules like `docs-guidelines.mdc` provide detailed, specific guidance
- Others like `naming-conventions.mdc` are brief and could benefit from expansion
- Several rules would benefit from concrete examples

## Conclusion

The current Cursor rules implementation provides a good foundation but requires standardization and enhancement to achieve an enterprise-grade configuration. The recommendations in this report provide a roadmap for transforming the ruleset into a more robust, maintainable system aligned with best practices.
