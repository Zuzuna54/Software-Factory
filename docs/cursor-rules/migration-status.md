## Enhancements Applied

All migrated rules have received the following enhancements:

1. **Consistent Structure**

   - Clear frontmatter with version and last updated date
   - Organized sections with hierarchical headings
   - Objective statement and verification checklist
   - Related rules and changelog sections

2. **Content Improvements**

   - Expanded explanations and rationale
   - Added concrete examples of good and bad practices
   - Included code snippets where applicable
   - Enhanced verification steps

3. **Documentation**
   - Created supporting documentation in `docs/cursor-rules/`
   - Implementation guide and best practices
   - Rule template for future rule creation
   - Migration status tracking

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Rule Splitting**

   - Further decompose backend-standards into specialized rules (auth, error handling)
   - Create additional templates for common backend patterns

2. **Frontend Rule Splitting**

   - Create state management rule from frontend-standards
   - Create accessibility standards rule
   - Add form handling best practices

3. **Template Library**

   - Expand the reference rules with additional templates

4. **Integration**
   - Update tooling to enforce new rule structure
   - Enable rule-specific linting in CI/CD

## Conclusion

The migration has successfully transformed the Cursor rules from a flat collection of guidelines to a well-structured, comprehensive system. The new organization improves maintainability, discoverability, and extensibility of the ruleset while ensuring consistent quality standards across the project.
