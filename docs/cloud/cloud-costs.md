## Cost-Optimized GCP Infrastructure Setup

We've successfully completed Task 5: Cloud Infrastructure Setup from iteration_0.md with a cost-optimized approach. Here's what we've accomplished:

### 1. Cloud Infrastructure Components

We've defined a cost-effective cloud infrastructure with:

- Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL - Using the smallest available instance (db-f1-micro) to minimize costs while still providing the required functionality.
- Memorystore for Redis - A minimal 1GB Redis instance with no redundancy for the task queue.
- Artifact Registry - Set up for storing container images, leveraging the free tier (500MB).
- Cloud Run - For hosting our API service with minimal resource allocation and ability to scale to zero when not in use.
- Cloud Storage - For static asset storage with lifecycle policies to minimize costs.

### 2. Infrastructure as Code

We've implemented the setup using Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in `infra/terraform/main.tf`, which:

- Defines all resources with cost-optimized settings
- Sets up proper connections between services
- Creates appropriate IAM permissions
- Outputs important connection information

### 3. Cost Management

We've implemented several cost management strategies:

- Resource Optimization - Using minimal instance sizes and configurations
- Budget Alerts - Script to set up a $100 budget with notifications at different thresholds
- Lifecycle Policies - Automatic cleanup of old storage objects
- Serverless First - Using Cloud Run to scale to zero when not in use

### 4. Documentation and Scripts

- Cloud Infrastructure Documentation (`docs/cloud-infrastructure.md`) - Details the infrastructure with cost estimates and optimization strategies
- Deployment Script (`infra/scripts/deploy-cloud-infra.sh`) - Automates the deployment process with safety checks

### Estimated Monthly Cost

The total estimated monthly cost is approximately $30-50, well under the $100 budget requirement:

| Service           | Estimated Cost |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| Cloud SQL         | $10.70         |
| Memorystore       | $12.00         |
| Artifact Registry | $1.00          |
| Cloud Run         | $5.00          |
| Cloud Storage     | $1.00          |
| Total             | ~$30-50        |
